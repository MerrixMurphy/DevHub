## Current Status: Refactor

A customer App Drawer designed to hold all the apps I make that are in development. It uses a recycler view to display them and allows users to select any apps they want. Besides that, it also allows for note creation using local saved data. You can update, delete, and create as many notes as you want, just like adding and removing apps.

The app is mostly complete and uses Kotlin as the language and Android Studio for where it was developed. There are a few bugs still, but I have put the project on hold until I finish my current schooling.
